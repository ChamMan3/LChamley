          <p>I am a full-stack web developer based in Denver, Colorado who is interested in any opportunity, regardless of location. </p>
    
        <p>As a lifelong gamer and a science enthusiast I've always been keen on learning more about tech (best exemplified by me building my first custom pc at age 16), but coming out of high school I didn't see my passion as a valid pursuit for a career. Three years in college later I realized the draw I feel towards the tech world would never leave me. I decided rather than switch majors to computer science and spend upwards of three more years at college, I would instead plunge right into the coding world headfirst by attending Flatiron School's software engineering program, and in November 2022 I graduated Flatiron's program with a much deeper understanding of software engineering.</p>
    
        <p>Since graduating my pursuit of knowledge hasn't stopped! I learned AWS and used it to deploy my first Flatiron School project (Lukon Drink Finder), I have been updating previous projects to maintain function and to add new features, and I have joined a ruby on rails startup group.</p>
    
        <p>Languages: JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Tailwind, React, Ruby on Rails, SQL (PostgreSQL, Sqlite3, MySQL)
          Tools: AWS, Heroku, Postman, Whimsical</p>
